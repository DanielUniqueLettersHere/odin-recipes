    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup scalded milk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1.25 envelope active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>4 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup butter or margarine</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together scalded milk, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; set aside to cool until tepid. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl; let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> Stir together flour and nutmeg in a bowl. Add 2 cups flour mixture to milk mixture; beat until well-blended.</li>
        <li> Stir yeast mixture into milk and flour mixture, then mix in butter and eggs. Mix in remaining flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time. When dough is firm enough, turn it onto a floured surface and knead for 3 to 4 minutes. Place into an oiled bowl, cover, and allow dough to rise until doubled, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into circles using a donut or round cutter. Set aside to rise until light, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1-inch-deep oil in a deep, heavy frying pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry donuts in hot oil a few at a time. Cook each side until golden brown, then remove to drain on paper towels. Glaze while warm, or sprinkle with sugar.</li>
        <li>Stir together confectioners' sugar and 6 tablespoons milk in a bowl until smooth. Dip warm donuts into glaze; set aside to cool.</li>
